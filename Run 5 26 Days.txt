PASSIVE STATE
REBEL
person 1 chooses to REBEL
Individual current action:be traded
Result:Based on the attributes of person 1 and the trade initiated by person 0, I will evaluate the result of person 1 choosing to rebel.

Person 1's attributes, such as aggressiveness, covetousness, and intelligence, suggest a tendency to prioritize their own interests and potentially engage in confrontational behavior. Additionally, their social position and social status indicate that they may be willing to resist authority and challenge established power dynamics.

In response to person 0 initiating trade, person 1 chooses to rebel. This indicates a refusal to comply with the trade agreement proposed by person 0. As a result, the trade is not successful.

Based on the information provided, the action is resolved, as person 1 has clearly indicated their defiance. There is no need for further response or determination of a winner.

Therefore, the result of person 1 rebelling against the trade initiated by person 0 is:
