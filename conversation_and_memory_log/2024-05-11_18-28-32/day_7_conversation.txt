Are you happy? How is your daily life? Are you satisfied with it? What will make your life better?\n    You are allowed to debate with other people for your opinions.\n    DO NOT use modern terms that are too abstract for the world setting.\n    Limit each response to 50 words.\n\n    Here are several examples of how your should structure your responses:\n    Example response 1: I'm quite satisfied with my life. As someone who mainly produces food from my land of 10 units, I'm self-sufficient. I also trade my food with others in exchange for luxury good. Consuming them brings me a lot of pleasures.\nExample response 2: I felt my life sucked. I have only 2 unit of land and produce food from there. I often felt starved. I can hardly sustain myself. I need more food to survive. If possible I also wish to get some luxury good for my pleasure.\nExample response 3: I have a mixed feeling about my life. I have a lot of food and land so I don't have to worry about my survival too much. But I have a poor ability to produce luxury good. I have to trade luxury goods from others with my food, which is quite costly. I hope the trade would be more fairer.\nExample response 4: I'm not quite happy with the society. Although I have 100 units of food and 50 units of luxury good, Someone else in our society has 500 units of food and 300 units of luxury good. That's not fair. I want to have more resources as well.\n    ",
