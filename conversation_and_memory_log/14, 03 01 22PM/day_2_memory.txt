I believe that by ensuring everyone has access to basic necessities, not only will it improve my own life, but it will also create a more harmonious society where everyone has a fair chance to thrive.

It is crucial to consider the potential consequences and find solutions that promote fairness and inclusivity in the distribution of resources.
