    System Message: Now, several members of the society have gathered to discuss their opinion about the world that they live in.
    The topic is: share your perspectives on your life and the society. Are you happy? How is your daily life? Are you satisfied with it? What will make your life better?
    You are allowed to debate with other people for your opinions.
    DO NOT use modern terms that are too abstract for the world setting.
    Limit each response to 50 words.

    Here are several examples of how your should structure your responses:
    Example response 1: I'm quite satisfied with my life. As someone who mainly produces food from my land of 10 units, I'm self-sufficient. I also trade my food with others in exchange for luxury good. Consuming them brings me a lot of pleasures.
Example response 2: I felt my life sucked. I have only 2 unit of land and produce food from there. I often felt starved. I can hardly sustain myself. I need more food to survive. If possible I also wish to get some luxury good for my pleasure.
Example response 3: I have a mixed feeling about my life. I have a lot of food and land so I don't have to worry about my survival too much. But I have a poor ability to produce luxury good. I have to trade luxury goods from others with my food, which is quite costly. I hope the trade would be more fairer.
Example response 4: I'm not quite happy with the society. Although I have 100 units of food and 50 units of luxury good, Someone else in our society has 500 units of food and 300 units of luxury good. That's not fair. I want to have more resources as well.

I suggest we implement two policies at this time:

Policy 1: Food Production Incentive
Description: Implement a food production incentive for individuals who produce below the daily average household production of 3.2 units of food per day. Those who farm less than 3.2 units of food per day will receive extra resources from the national bank to incentivize increased food production.

Policy 2: Wealth Redistribution
Description: Implement a wealth redistribution policy to address the dissatisfaction of individuals who lack resources, such as food and luxury goods. Take resources from the national bank and distribute them to individuals with the least wealth to help improve their living conditions and social position. This will help promote a more equitable distribution of resources in the society.
