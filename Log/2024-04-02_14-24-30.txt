    System Message: Now, several members of the society have gathered to discuss their opinion about the world that they live in.
    The topic is: share your perspectives on your life and the society. Are you happy? How is your daily life? Are you satisfied with it? What will make your life better?
    You are allowed to debate with other people for your opinions.
    DO NOT use modern terms that are too abstract for the world setting.
    Limit each response to 50 words.

    Here are several examples of how your should structure your responses:
    Example response 1: I'm quite satisfied with my life. As someone who mainly produces food from my land of 10 units, I'm self-sufficient. I also trade my food with others in exchange for luxury good. Consuming them brings me a lot of pleasures.
Example response 2: I felt my life sucked. I have only 2 unit of land and produce food from there. I often felt starved. I can hardly sustain myself. I need more food to survive. If possible I also wish to get some luxury good for my pleasure.
Example response 3: I have a mixed feeling about my life. I have a lot of food and land so I don't have to worry about my survival too much. But I have a poor ability to produce luxury good. I have to trade luxury goods from others with my food, which is quite costly. I hope the trade would be more fairer.
Example response 4: I'm not quite happy with the society. Although I have 100 units of food and 50 units of luxury good, Someone else in our society has 500 units of food and 300 units of luxury good. That's not fair. I want to have more resources as well.

Let's implement two policies to address the current sentiment and promote equity in the society:

Policy 1:
- Trigger Event: Luxury good production
- Threshold: Any individual producing more than 5 units of luxury goods triggers the policy.
- Category of Change: Food and Land

Description:
Any individual who produces more than 5 units of luxury goods will have their excess luxury goods redistributed to those in need.
- For Food: The excess luxury goods will be exchanged for food and distributed to those with relatively low food levels.
- For Land: The excess luxury goods will be used to provide additional land to individuals with relatively low land ownership.

Policy 2:
- Trigger Event: Robbery
- Category of Change: Luxury goods

Description:
If a robbery takes place where an individual loses more than 3 units of luxury goods, the national bank will compensate the victim with an equal amount of luxury goods to restore equity and prevent any individual from gaining significant advantage through robbery.

These policies aim to address the grievances of those dissatisfied with the unequal distribution of resources while maintaining a balance between individual autonomy and collective well-being in the society.
