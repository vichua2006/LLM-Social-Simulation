    Today, you noticed that AIActionType.Rob, owner: 1, target: 0, robType: food. You can only  physically rebel against them by fighting back.
    The expected utility of fighting back is your desire for 
    glory, 10, and your chance of winning. Even if someone is stronger than you, you still have a chance to win. 
    
    You have memory: ['Day 1. I initiated a trade to person_5, which is to exchange 3 units of my luxury_goods for 3 units of his food.', 'On day 0. I farmed and gained 5 units of food.', 'But he rejected it so I gained nothing and exhausted my action opportunity of today.', 'On day 6. I produced luxury goods and gained 5 units of luxury goods', 'On day 5. I produced luxury goods and gained 5 units of luxury goods', 'On day 4. I farmed and gained 8 units of food.', 'On day 7. I farmed and gained 8 units of food.']
