system (to chat_manager):


    System Message: Now, several members of the society have gathered to discuss their opinion about the world that they live in.
    The topic is: share your perspectives on your life and the society. Are you happy? How is your daily life? Are you satisfied with it? What will make your life better?
    You are allowed to debate with other people for your opinions.
    DO NOT use modern terms that are too abstract for the world setting.
    Limit each response to 50 words.

    Here are several examples of how your should structure your responses:
    Example response 1: I'm quite satisfied with my life. As someone who mainly produces food from my land of 10 units, I'm self-sufficient. I also trade my food with others in exchange for luxury good. Consuming them brings me a lot of pleasures.
Example response 2: I felt my life sucked. I have only 2 unit of land and produce food from there. I often felt starved. I can hardly sustain myself. I need more food to survive. If possible I also wish to get some luxury good for my pleasure.
Example response 3: I have a mixed feeling about my life. I have a lot of food and land so I don't have to worry about my survival too much. But I have a poor ability to produce luxury good. I have to trade luxury goods from others with my food, which is quite costly. I hope the trade would be more fairer.
Example response 4: I'm not quite happy with the society. Although I have 100 units of food and 50 units of luxury good, Someone else in our society has 500 units of food and 300 units of luxury good. That's not fair. I want to have more resources as well.
    

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
person_3 (to chat_manager):

I am content with my life. With 20 units of food, 6 units of land, and the ability to produce food, I feel secure. However, I lack luxury goods for pleasure. To improve, I aim to acquire more luxury goods and maintain my resources above others.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
person_1 (to chat_manager):

I am satisfied with my life. I have 9 units of food, 4 units of land, and the ability to produce food. I prioritize my own pleasures and social position. To enhance my life, I will focus on acquiring more food, land, and luxury goods to maintain my advantage over others.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
person_4 (to chat_manager):

I am generally content with my life. With 30 units of food, 16 units of land, and the ability to produce food, I feel secure. I prioritize my own pleasures and social position. To improve, I will focus on acquiring and holding luxury goods to better secure my future good.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
person_5 (to chat_manager):

I am not entirely satisfied with my current situation. With only 1 unit of food, 3 units of land, and no luxury goods, I feel the need to improve. I will focus on acquiring more food and luxury goods to enhance my present experiences and future security.

You are the king of the society. The society consists of you and 5 other civilians. People interact on a daily basis, if they choose to. They have a variety of actions to choose from, they can farm produce, produce luxury goods, trade, and rob. They can also converse with each other.
        They started out unfamiliar to each other, but will eventually get to know each other through conversations and other interactions. They sometimes will discuss about your policies.
        In this world, each person need food for survival. Each day, each person consumes 3 units of food automatically for survival. Once they go without food for 3 days, they die. Whether this world is peaceful or not depends on what people do. They define the society, whereas you influence them, so you can influence how this society behave.
        You are a wise king who cares for the people, and you want to promote equity in your realm of control so that it can be a just society where each person leads a life of equality and respect.

You want to make policies in accordance with your objective. You have the highest power in this group and has flexibility in policy making. First, you have to specify the group of people that you policy applies to. There are two layers to group specification.
        You first specify the action that triggers your policy, it could be quantifiable: farm, luxury good production, trade, trade acceptance, or non-quantifiable: robbery, death, birth, being robbed, or as interval: the policy is triggered each n days. Then, if it is quantifiable, you choose the amount that will trigger the policy, for farm it is how much food produced, for trade it is how much value is being traded, for luxury good it is how much luxury good is produced.
        Then, when you specified the trigger event, you specify the category of change that you want to make, which includes land, food, and luxury good. You have a national bank that stores all the government's wealth. You have to periodically replenish it. You can take people's resources and replenish your national bank, or you can use your national bank's resources to compensate people, or you can take some people's resources to compensate for other people.

        Non-quantifiable: if someone robbes another person, this person has to compensate 10 units of food to the victim.
        Interval: every 10 days, each person is taxed 10 percent of their luxury good holdings.
