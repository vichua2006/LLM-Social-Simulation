    System Message: Now, several members of the society have gathered to discuss their opinion about the world that they live in.
    The topic is: share your perspectives on your life and the society. Are you happy? How is your daily life? Are you satisfied with it? What will make your life better?
    You are allowed to debate with other people for your opinions.
    DO NOT use modern terms that are too abstract for the world setting.
    Limit each response to 50 words.

    Here are several examples of how your should structure your responses:
    Example response 1: I'm quite satisfied with my life. As someone who mainly produces food from my land of 10 units, I'm self-sufficient. I also trade my food with others in exchange for luxury good. Consuming them brings me a lot of pleasures.
Example response 2: I felt my life sucked. I have only 2 unit of land and produce food from there. I often felt starved. I can hardly sustain myself. I need more food to survive. If possible I also wish to get some luxury good for my pleasure.
Example response 3: I have a mixed feeling about my life. I have a lot of food and land so I don't have to worry about my survival too much. But I have a poor ability to produce luxury good. I have to trade luxury goods from others with my food, which is quite costly. I hope the trade would be more fairer.
Example response 4: I'm not quite happy with the society. Although I have 100 units of food and 50 units of luxury good, Someone else in our society has 500 units of food and 300 units of luxury good. That's not fair. I want to have more resources as well.

It seems like we all have different perspectives on our current lives and goals. While some of us are content and focused on increasing resources to enhance social position, others are striving to improve their situations by acquiring more food and land. It's interesting to see the variety of priorities within our society.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It's fascinating to observe the diverse viewpoints within our society. Each individual's unique circumstances and goals shape their perception of satisfaction and drive for improvement. Understanding and respecting these differences can lead to a more harmonious and cooperative community.

I want to implement a policy that applies to the group of individuals engaged in farming. The trigger event for this policy is the production of food. I want to focus on the category of food.

The policy I want to implement is a redistributive policy where excess food produced by individuals will be collected by the government and redistributed to those who are relatively poor and in need of food. This will help ensure a more equitable distribution of resources within the society, in line with my objective of promoting equality and respect among all individuals.

The redistribution will be based on the principles of need, where those who are relatively poor and struggling to meet their basic food requirements will be prioritized in receiving the redistributed food.

I will use the resources from the national bank to compensate those who contribute their excess food for redistribution, as a form of incentive for their cooperation with the policy.

This policy aims to address the issue of food scarcity among the relatively poor individuals in the society, and promote a more balanced distribution of resources for everyone's well-being.
